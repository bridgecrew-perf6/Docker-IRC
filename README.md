![logo](https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1560750?s=200&v=4)

InspIRCd is a modular Internet Relay Chat (IRC) server written in C++. It was created from scratch to be stable, modern and lightweight. It provides a tunable number of features through the use of an advanced but well documented module system. By keeping core functionality to a minimum we hope to increase the stability, security and speed of InspIRCd while also making it customisable to the needs of many different users.

## Usage

```bash
docker pull hatamiarash7/irc-server
docker run -d --name irc -p 6667:6667 hatamiarash7/irc-server
```
