InspIRCd is a modular Internet Relay Chat (IRC) server written in C++. It was created from scratch to be stable, modern and lightweight. It provides a tunable number of features through the use of an advanced but well documented module system. By keeping core functionality to a minimum we hope to increase the stability, security and speed of InspIRCd while also making it customisable to the needs of many different users.
